# Module: locations

**Short:** Locations directory + detail pages for Sansthan accommodations.

**Purpose:** Provide devotees a clear, mobile-friendly directory of Sansthan-managed accommodation locations (facilities, amenities, contacts) with a direct path to the booking request flow.

**Entry points:**
- `src/app/locations/page.tsx`
- `src/app/locations/[id]/page.tsx`

**Files:**
- `components/LocationCard.tsx` — location preview card with “Details” and “Book” CTAs
- `components/AmenityList.tsx` — amenity rendering for detail pages
- `MODULE_DOC.md` — this document

**Data source:**
- `src/data/sansthan-data.ts` — `sansthanLocations` (images, facilities, amenities, contacts)

**Flow diagram:**

  detail --> contact[WhatsAppOrCall_BookingHelp]
  detail --> bookingPage[BookingLandingPage_Optional]
```

**Behaviors:**
- **Mobile-first**: grid collapses to one column; room types table scrolls horizontally on small screens.
- **Performance**: uses Next `Image` for cards and the primary detail image to reduce layout shift.
- **Pre-rendered routes**: all known locations are statically generated for better crawlability and faster loads.
- **Booking CTA**: primary CTAs use WhatsApp/Call. The `/booking` landing page supports `?location=<id>` to preselect a location when linking from location pages.
- **Geo SEO signals**: each location now includes coordinates used to generate geo meta tags on detail pages (`geo.position`, `geo.placename`, `geo.region`, `ICBM`).
- **Verification support**: `npm run verify:locations` validates canonical + geo meta + schema presence on all prerendered location detail pages.

**Dependencies:**
- **Data**: `src/data/sansthan-data.ts`
- **UI primitives**: `src/components/ui/*`
- **Libraries**: `next/image`, `lucide-react`

**Env vars:**
- None required.

**Tests:**
- Not yet added.
