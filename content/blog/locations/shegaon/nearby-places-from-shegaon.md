# Nearby Places from Shegaon

Many devotees visiting Shegaon for darshan also plan one or two nearby places for spiritual reflection and family time. This guide helps you create a practical and peaceful itinerary.

## Start with temple darshan and accommodation

Before local sightseeing, confirm your stay and darshan plan:

- [Shegaon Bhakt Niwas](/locations/shegaon-bhakt-niwas)
- [Shegaon Anand Vihar](/locations/shegaon-anand-vihar)
- [Booking request page](/booking)

## 1. Anand Sagar

Anand Sagar is a popular stop for families, especially for those staying at or near Anand Vihar. It offers a serene setting and works well as a half-day visit.

## 2. Local devotional landmarks in Shegaon

Devotees often spend time in temple-adjacent zones and devotional pathways around the Sansthan complex. Keep this part of your trip unhurried to preserve the spiritual experience.

## 3. Plan nearby city extensions only if time allows

If your family has an extra day, you can extend toward other pilgrimage destinations in Maharashtra. Keep travel buffers, especially for elders and children.

## Suggested 2-day Shegaon plan

- Day 1: Darshan + rest + evening prayers
- Day 2: Anand Sagar + local spiritual points + return
