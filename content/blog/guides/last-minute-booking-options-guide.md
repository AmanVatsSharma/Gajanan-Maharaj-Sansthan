# Last Minute Booking Options Guide | Shri Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan

This guide helps devotees compare multiple locations connected to Shri Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan and related pilgrimage circuits. It is ideal for families planning a structured trip across Shegaon, Omkareshwar, Pandharpur, and Trimbakeshwar.

## Core planning actions

1. Decide the primary darshan priority for your family.
2. Assign travel days with enough rest intervals.
3. Keep accommodation communication centralized.
4. Prepare emergency contacts and health essentials.

## Cross-location travel tips

When visiting multiple Sansthan locations, allow buffer time between cities for rest and local travel.
